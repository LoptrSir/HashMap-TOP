//TOP lesson HashMap

5/14 It seems increasing array length requires refactoring each node into a tempBuckets array of 32, deleting current buckets, updating buckets to 32 then migrating tempBuckets to buckets.
 Issues at hand:
Rehash needs to be based on the new length which pulls from buckets constructor: copy array, delete buckets, update buckets length.
How do I delete the node after rehashing/assignment; review existing code.
How do i delete the existing buckets after rehashing all nodes.
How do I update buckets to 32 after the fact: run formula at the end prior to the merge?

5/13  Refactoring new array to increase size.  It seems to refactor the array but does'nt terminate and throws a cannot read properties of undefined line 55.  The array is 16 slots with 12 items.  do it seems to have refactored the nodes but the array is 16 not 32.
